Title:
Evaluating the Influence of Vehicle Lateral Deviation on Extra Widening Requirements for Two-Lane Undivided Roads

Organization:
Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati
Duration:
May 10 â€“ July 10, 2025

Overview:
During this internship, I developed a comprehensive, data-driven framework to study real-world vehicle behavior on curved roads. The project integrated high-resolution trajectory analysis, advanced behavior classification techniques, and systematic benchmarking of design standards.

Key Contributions:

ðŸ”¹ Developed a Modular Python Toolkit:
Created 12+ reusable scripts for:

* Data cleaning and merging
* Trajectory projection and deviation computation
* Overtaking detection and classification
* Encroachment analysis
* Steering entropy computation and driver behavior categorization
* Automated visualization (boxplots, line charts, correlation matrices)

ðŸ”¹ Systematic Literature Review:
Conducted a PRISMA-compliant review of 95 international studies and codal documents (IRC, AASHTO, Austroads, DMRB, JTG).
Identified persistent gaps between codal assumptions and observed driver behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Trajectory Data Acquisition and Analysis:
Processed field-collected datasets (Total Station and drone surveys) for multiple vehicle classes (cars, LCVs, trucks, bikes).
Quantified lateral deviation, curve widening, and encroachment patterns across curve types (transition and circular).

ðŸ”¹ Behavior Classification:
Applied Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to third-order steering entropy to classify drivers as Normal, Distracted, or Erratic.
Found that approximately 42% of drivers exhibited non-normal steering patterns, exceeding standard assumptions.

ðŸ”¹ Codal Benchmarking:
Compared observed widening with IRC 73:1980 and other standards, showing real-world deviations often 2â€“2.5Ã— larger than codal allowances.

ðŸ”¹ Recommendations:
Proposed adaptive widening provisions that account for vehicle type, curve geometry, and behavioral variability.
Advocated for integrating empirical trajectory data and driver behavior metrics into geometric design standards.

Skills & Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Data Visualization, PRISMA Framework, Statistical Modeling, Transportation Engineering

Outcome:
This internship established a reproducible methodology and analytical toolkit to support evidence-based revisions to roadway design standards, enhancing safety and operational performance in mixed-traffic environments.
